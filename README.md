In this final chart we can see that subscribers utilize the service more than casual customers.

## Summary

The above visulaizations provide insight into how successful this program can be and also provide a marketing perspective.
- Males are more likely to use the service.
- Subscribers utilize the service more than casual customers. This could lead to a subscriber incentive program to generate more revenue and clients.
- There are peak hours of usage that mirror weekday commuter traffic. Utilize this data to ensure enough bikes are available for the peak hours.
- Best time for bike repairs would be in the early morning hours on any given weekday. If repairs need to be done during daylight hours, then Wednesday would be the optimal day.

Finally, we could utilize more data from the NYC data set in order to dig deeper. One area would be reviewing starting and ending locations. This visual would allow for precise location review in order to determine bike placement for easier access for users.

One other opportunity for marketing purposes would be to utilize the birth year data. This would be similar to the gender breakdwon and review age ranges by birth year to see the most common age range of users.
